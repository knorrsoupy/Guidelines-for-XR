# **Guide to XR**
#### **Intro**
Hi, I am Souparna, your friend or Clippy (10 points if you can guess who am i refering to :P).  
I am currently pursuing my masters in XR Design and trying to create a handbook or guidebook for people who are jumping straight into XR.These are my personal thoughts and learnings that i had along the way and will keep on updating as i move forward. <br>
*Some concepts and ideas might be obsolete at the time of writing this, but anyways, let the learning begin.* **Hope it helps ðŸ˜Š**

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">NOTE: These are my understandings and theories which might be wrong. In any case, don't take this as the be-all and end-all. As designers, we need to embrace change and create solutions accordingly.</span>

#### **What is XR?**
It is an umbrella term, X = {Virtual, Mixed, Augmented} and R = Reality; that is about it.  
**Virtual** - Everything is virtual. When you put on the headset, the environment around you is created.  
**Augmented** - You place virtual objects in the real world, something juxtaposed on top of reality.  
**Mixed** - You blend these two, and you get mixed reality.

*Remember, Augmented Reality and Augmented Virtuality mixed together gets you to MIXED REALITY.*

#### **About XR Design**
The traditional UX design for 2D Interfaces is vastly different for XR Interfaces, why? **because there are no constraints!**. but this is great right? Not really, with constraints your ideas are sort of grounded and fixed in a direction but here you can theoritically design anything. The processes we follow for XR Design is generally the same albeit with some caveats.

#### **Tools Required**

There is a resources tab which will have all the resources that i had used in my journey in the field of XR. Happy hunting.!
